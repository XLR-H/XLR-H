- 👋 Hi, I’m @XLR-H, Rafael Gozzo
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end, front-end, games...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything python or game related
- 📫 My portfolio is in here, with all my socials and contacts
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an unusual combination of nerd, jock and dad. While I'm mostly a dev and gamer, I also do karate and home repair stuff ☺
